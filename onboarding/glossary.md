<li><strong>Transaction fee</strong>: <em>a fee charged for each transaction.</em></li>
<li><strong>Transaction</strong>: <em>an atomic event.</em></li>
<li><strong>Uncle</strong>: <em>an uncle is a block generated simultaneously with another block leading to a not-simultaneous acceptance of both blocks, i.e. a delay. In Ethereum, this block creation delay has to be resolved by finding consensus on which of the new blocks is going to be the next one. The block that is rejected, the one with the lowest share of proof-of-work, becomes an uncle block. The block with the larger share of proof-of-work becomes part of the blockchain as a normal block.</em></li>
