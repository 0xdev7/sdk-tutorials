This online course aims at giving a comprehensive understanding of blockchain technology and technology-related concepts to provide the fundamentals needed to **understand blockchain technology, on what technologies it builds, and how it came into being**. After a general introduction to blockchain, a more detailed view at Cosmos is presented.

During this course we are aiming to answer the following questions:

* What does the term *blockchain* cover? What does it mean?
* What are the technical fundamentals that allowed for the development of blockchain technology?
* How do different approaches and protocols work? What are the characteristics of each?
* How does the blockchain protocol landscape look like?
* How did Cosmos came into being?
* What is the value added Cosmos brings to the blockchain landscape?
* What is the Cosmos SDK?
* How does Tendermint Core provide consensus for Cosmos?
* In which way are chains connected through IBC?
* For what do you use CosmJS, CosmWasm, and Starport?

<h2 class="mt-4 mb-6">Going through the onboarding course?</h2>

This course is **self-paced**. We do recommend working on it continuously. You can expect content of about three to five hours a week. In addition to the course material, you will have a chance to discuss the content and ask questions in your **dedicated Slack channel** and **weekly study group calls**.

The **order of the chapters and sections** represents the recommended curriculum, but you are of course completely free to go through the content in whatever order you prefer and works best for you.

You can also find a **glossary** in this course containing the most common terms used in blockchain and the Cosmos space and a short explanation for each.
